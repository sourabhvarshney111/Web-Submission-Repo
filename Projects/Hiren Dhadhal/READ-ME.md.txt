There is a zip file for the code.So after extracting it as node-modules have been deleted all the dependencies will have to installed.
Firstly use "npm init" for inialising.
Then download all depencies of backend :=
"npm i express mongoose body-parser passport passport-jwt jsonwebtoken  validator concurrently".
For Dev dependencies "npm i -D nodemon".
That will be it for backend.

Type "npm install" for install all the dependencies for Frontend.
That should be it and your package.json should look like this :-

"dependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^4.2.4",
    "@testing-library/react": "^9.5.0",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^7.2.1",
    "axios": "^0.19.2",
    "classnames": "^2.2.6",
    "jwt-decode": "^2.2.0",
    "react": "^16.13.1",
    "react-dom": "^16.13.1",
    "react-redux": "^7.2.0",
    "react-router-dom": "^5.2.0",
    "react-scripts": "3.4.1",
    "react-types": "^0.1.0",
    "redux": "^4.0.5",
    "redux-thunk": "^2.3.0"
  }, for frontend [client folder]

and 

"dependencies": {
    "bcryptjs": "^2.4.3",
    "body-parser": "^1.19.0",
    "concurrently": "^5.2.0",
    "create-react-app": "^3.4.1",
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "jsonwebtoken": "^8.5.1",
    "mongoose": "^5.9.18",
    "passport": "^0.4.1",
    "passport-jwt": "^4.0.0",
    "validator": "^13.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^2.0.4"
  }
 for backend.

Now run the command "npm run dev" which will first start backend server and then frontend server will also give a message "Mongodb connected"
and open your browser if this happens everything is working well.


NOW about the site.
Its just a simple site with signup,login and logout features not much styled.
Firstly user will Register after going to that page and after successful registration he will be directed to login form where on successful login
he will be taken to dashboard where he can sell his products.And there he can logout which will take him back to the login page.
